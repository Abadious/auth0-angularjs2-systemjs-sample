# Calling API example.

There is a very simple Express server [here](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-angularjs2-systemjs-sample/tree/master/Server). Run it and then start this app to send secure pings to an API.

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.
